Algorithms and Data Structures Cheat Sheet
------------------------------------------
Tired and afraid of having to read thick books on how to prepare for coding interviews?
This repo holds a good starting point of common coding problems asked during technical interviews. 
Small, simple, fast and right to the important parts (as long as you have a basic background on algorithms, data structures and C++).

### How to compile a file
Code uses some C++11 features. In case you forgot, to compile a file you have to execute something like this:

    g++ -std=c++11 trees.cpp -o trees
    ./trees

### Suggested study order
Study and check the source code of the files using this suggested order:
     
**01.** `arrays.cpp`
**02.** `strings.cpp`
**03.** `bits.cpp`
**04.** `stacks.cpp`
**05.** `trees.cpp`
**06.** `lists.cpp`
**07.** `search_sort.cpp` (WIP)
**08.** `graphs.cpp` (WIP)
**09.** `backtrack.cpp` (WIP)
**10.** `dynamicprogramming.cpp` (WIP)
