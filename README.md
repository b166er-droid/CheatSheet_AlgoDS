Algorithms and Data Structures Cheat Sheet
------------------------------------------
Tired and afraid of having to read thick books on how to prepare for coding interviews?

This repo holds a good starting point of common coding problems asked during technical interviews. 

Small, simple, fast and right to the important parts (as long as you have a basic background on algorithms, data structures and C++).

### How to compile a file
Code uses some C++11 features. In case you forgot, to compile a file you have to execute something like this:

    g++ -std=c++11 trees.cpp -o trees
    ./trees

### Suggested study order
Study and check the source code of the files using this suggested order:
     
1. `arrays.cpp` 
2. `strings.cpp` 
3. `bits.cpp` 
4. `stacks.cpp` 
5. `trees.cpp` 
6. `lists.cpp` 
7. `search_sort.cpp` -*includes binary heaps*- 
8. `graphs.cpp` (WIP) 
9. `backtrack.cpp` (WIP) 
10. `dynamicprogramming.cpp` (WIP)
